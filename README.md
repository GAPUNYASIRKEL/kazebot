## Features

- **Dynamic Configuration:** Change settings such as the default search platform via Discord commands.
- **Centralized Logging:** Configurable logging levels (debug, info, warn, error) to help you monitor and troubleshoot the bot.

   ```

3. **Set up Lavalink:**

   Follow the [Lavalink setup guide](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink) to install and run a Lavalink server. Adjust the Lavalink settings in your configuration file accordingly.

## Configuration

  "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
  "prefix": ".",
  "lavalinkPassword": "youshallnotpass",
  "lavalinkHost": "localhost",
  "lavalinkPort": 2333,
  "clientId": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "username": "ExampleMusicBot",
  "defaultSearchPlatform": "ytsearch",
  "logLevel": "info"
}
```

- **token**: Your bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- **prefix**: The command prefix you want to use (e.g., `.`).
- **lavalinkPassword**: The password you set in your Lavalink server configuration.
- **lavalinkHost**: The hostname or IP of your Lavalink server (e.g., `localhost`).

- **clientId**: Your botâ€™s application/client ID from the Discord Developer Portal.
- **username**: (Optional) A display name used internally or for logging.
